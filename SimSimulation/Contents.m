% SimulatorToolbox:SimSimulation%% Utility functions used internally in the simulation% code. Not meant to be called from outside.%%   SimAdjustSensors            - Adjust sensor sensitivities for units, exposure, f-stop, etc.%   SimComputeSensorWeights     - Compute weights between hyperspectral images and camera sensors.%   SimDoNothingOnImage         - Placeholder for simulation pipeline.%   SimMosaic                   - Simulate spatial sampling with color mosaics.%   SimNonlinearity             - Simulate camera non-linearity.%   SimOpticalBlur              - Simulate optical blur.%   SimSimulateCamera           - Implement simulation steps in order.%   SimHyperPowerToQuanta       - Convert hyperspectral image in Watts to quanta/sec.%   SimWattsToQuantaFactor      - Convert from Watts in world to quanta in image.%   SimWeightRawImages          - Simulate sensor responses from hyperspectral images.% Copyright (c) 1998, 1999 by David Brainard & Philippe Longere.
