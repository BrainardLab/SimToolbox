% TODO.m%% List of things to do on the simulator, in no particular% order.%% 1/15/99  dhb  Consolidated lots of little pieces of paper here.% 4/16/99  dhb  Removed a number of things that were done.% 4/23/99  dhb  Removed one more item.%% *) Sort out camera files, make sure that the physical% parameters on each are correct.%% *) Think about whether we really want the full image filepath% in the image files.  Things would be simpler to configure if% the image read routine just assumed one image per directory.%% *) Data directory still needs some organization.  I'd like% to get rid of the illuminannts that are specific to particular% hyperspectral images by including the actual illuminant as% part of the image structure.  Other misc. data files need% to be documented as to what they are.%% *) Compile and test SimFastReadRaw image on more platforms,% and make sure that the big/little endian conventions work,% and that data types are handled consistently.  PXL HAS DONE% THIS TO SOME DEGREE.%% *) SimGriddataInterp doesn't look like it is implemented% for big images.  At least, there are several comments about% things to be done inside of it.%% *) It is important to think through where in the simulation chain% the camera file ought to be re-written, as the image makes its% way from hyperspectral to simulated in a series of steps.%% *) We now have a convention that when images/cameras/monitors are% passed as names to a function, they get read, while if they are% passed as structs they are used.  This needs to be implemented% uniformily across all functions.%% *) Quantal code needs to be tested.
